8- To remove from your git staging area but it will be present in the directory:
	"git rm --cached <file_name>
	note: --cached flag is very important as if we dont use it in our command the file will be removed from both the git staging area as well as from our directory.

    To remove many files(these files will be in another sub-directory) at once from git staging area:
	"git rm -r --cached <directory/>

9- To use .gitignore file to stop any files to be added in your git staging area:
	"touch .gitignore" (it will create a .gitignorefile"
	"nano .gitignore" (add the file names which you dont want to add in your git staging area)

    To push your work from local to remote repo:
	"git push -u origin master" (here -u is upstream which will connect our local epo to remote repo)

14- To clone any remote repo(https method):
	"git clone "https://..........."


15- We can use ssh url in to link our local repo to our remote repo:
	*fist generate the public ssh key and paste it in github ssh settings.
	*copy the ssh url of your remote repo.
	"git remote set-url git@github.com:MohdFazalm99/learnit_git.git"

	*To check which remote url is linked with your local repo:
	"git remote -v"



16- To create branches in git:
	"git branch new_branch" (it will only create a branch not switched to that branch)
	"git checkout -b new_branch1"(this command will create and switched to that specific branch)
